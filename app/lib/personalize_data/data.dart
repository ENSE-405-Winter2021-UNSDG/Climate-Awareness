  By becoming more energy-efficient, you not only pollute less but save utilities bill too. Here are following tips you can consider taking action. Together they can really add up.\n
  · Turn off lights you’re not using and when you leave the room. Replace incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent or LED ones.\n
  · Adjust your thermostat. Don’t set it too high or low. Install a programmable model to turn off the heat/air conditioning when you’re not home.\n
  · Swap your gas stove for an electric stove, which will also lower indoor air pollution.\n
  · Wash clothes in cold water. Hang-dry your clothes when you can and use dryer balls when you can’t.\n
